## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- Stdin pipe support: `echo "question" | az-ai`, `cat file | az-ai "summarize"` — combines piped content with prompt arguments
- `--json` output mode for scripting and automation
- `--version` / `-v` flag to display current version
- Progress spinner (braille animation) on stderr while waiting for first token
- Input validation with 32K character prompt limit
- Azure-specific exception handling for HTTP 401, 403, 404, and 429 responses
- Configurable streaming timeout via `AZURE_TIMEOUT` environment variable
- Configurable `AZURE_MAX_TOKENS` and `AZURE_TEMPERATURE` environment variables
- Restrictive file permissions (chmod 600) on config file at creation
- API key validation before client creation
- HTTPS endpoint validation
- xUnit test project with 16 unit tests
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- SECURITY.md — comprehensive security documentation
- ARCHITECTURE.md — system design and component documentation
- CONTRIBUTING.md — developer onboarding guide
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md — Contributor Covenant v2.1
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- Pull request template
- Copilot agent archetypes: Costanza (PM), Kramer (engineer), Newman, Elaine, Jerry
- 5 feature proposals (FR-001 through FR-005) with priority matrix and shipping timeline

### Changed
- Upgraded from .NET 9.0-preview to .NET 10.0 stable
- Upgraded Dockerfile base images from preview tags to stable
- Optimized Dockerfile layer ordering for faster rebuilds
- Removed redundant COPY instruction in Dockerfile
- Credentials now injected via `--env-file` at runtime instead of baked into image
- Makefile: added `help`, `test`, and `smoke-test` targets
- README: added badges, configuration reference table, and exit code documentation

### Fixed
- Removed `.env` credential bundling from Docker image (security vulnerability)
- Generic exception handling replaced with Azure-specific error handlers
- Stream null check for content delta updates

### Security
- Container credentials are no longer baked into Docker images
- API key is validated before Azure OpenAI client creation
- HTTPS endpoint validation prevents insecure connections
- Config file restricted to owner-only access (chmod 600 on Unix)

## [1.0.1] — 2025-12-04

### Added
- Multi-model selection support: `--models`, `--set-model`, `--current-model` flags
- Feature proposals README with priority matrix
- Copilot agent definitions (Costanza, Kramer)

### Fixed
- Improved exception handling based on code review feedback (modern C# range syntax, named constants)

## [1.0.0] — 2025-08-17

### Added
- Initial release
- Azure OpenAI chat completion via Docker container
- Streaming responses (token-by-token output)
- System prompt configuration via `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable
- Docker-first architecture with Alpine Linux base image
- Non-root container execution (`appuser`)
- `.dockerignore` for minimal build context

### Security
- Switched to Alpine Linux for reduced attack surface (OWASP/Snyk compliance)
- Fixed 2 critical and several high-severity container vulnerabilities
- Vulnerability scanning integrated into workflow
